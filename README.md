# ASP.NET-Web-Sample-Code
This is a sample code for ASP.NET Core Web API with Swagger Authorization

In this project:
The "Models" folder holds the classes for Database Tables.
This folder also holds the modelContext class for DbContext which provides access to DB operations.
the EntitiesClass class holds the lists created in the DB.
The "Controllers" folder holds the controllers for classes to be displayed on Swagger UI.
The "Services" folder has been created to hold authentication details for the user.
The BasicAuthenticationHandler class is required for authentication -- I'll add more once I know what it's for.
There have been made some changes in the original Startup folder to accomodate Swagger.
